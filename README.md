git branch :
Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add 
a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
when we want to make some updates, fix bugs, or implement some thing new to the project, the we can create a new
branch and work on it and finally when everything works the we can merge it to main branch.
